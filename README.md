# Optiver Zap-N Training Games

Practice games to prepare for Optiver's Zap-N cognitive assessment. These games train the core skills tested in the actual assessment: reaction time, pattern recognition, and working memory.

## Games

### Shapeshift (`shapeshift.html`)
**Trains:** Reaction time, visual processing

React to shapes appearing anywhere on screen:
- Press **→** for circles
- Press **←** for squares

### Code-Compare (`code-compare.html`)
**Trains:** Visual memory, pattern recognition

Memorize a 7-character code and find its exact match among 4 similar options. Time decreases each round (15s down to 3s).

**Tip:** Assign sounds to digits (e.g., "zee" for 0, "wun" for 1) to use both visual and auditory memory.

### Digit (`digit.html`)
**Trains:** Working memory, sequence recall

Watch a sequence of digits flash on screen, then recall them:
- Level 1: Enter digits in same order
- Level 2+: Enter digits in REVERSE order

Sequence length increases as you progress.
